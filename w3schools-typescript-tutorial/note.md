TypeScript is just JavaScript with some additional features: static typing, interfaces, classes, generics, compile-time checking, decorators, etc.
TypeScript code is transformed into JavaScript code via the TypeScript compiler or Babel.
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code.
TypeScript is a statically typed language, which means that you can catch errors and bugs before the code runs.
TypeScript is a strongly typed language, which means that you can define the type of a variable when you declare it.
TypeScript is a compiled language, which means that you need to compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript code before you can run it.
